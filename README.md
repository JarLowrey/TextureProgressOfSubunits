## TextureProgressOfSubunits

Godot asset to create a texture progress (health bar) of individual subunits

### Why?

A simple progress bar does not give any visual indication of how much "stuff" is left. 
Historically, a label is given to show this: `400/640` for example.
Some games, like Overwatch, solve this problem by making the health bar out of individual subunits that give an immediate indication of the amount of health each character has.
